The word “Auto pilot” mode here refers to the process of implementing the advanced technology in vehicles which enables it to self-drive in high way roads without the control of the humans. This process is going to be achieved by the use of Radars, Sensors and Advanced GPS maps. First a compact path of the place where user wants to go is selected on the GPS map.
When the engine is started, all equipment’s will start to take positioning. The readings are obtained from the radar every second. It detects the objects at the limit of 180’ angle and continuously feed the control unit. This control unit is built with a lot of conditions that makes the vehicle to move in the possible safe directions. Here 50% of the job is done by the radar equipment’s and rest of the job is done by the advanced GPS mapping to make a safe journey. Separate signals are obtained from the ground level to detect the speed breakers and conditions of the road. Same set of equipment’s is fixed on the rear side of the vehicle to avoid other vehicles hit on rear side of the user’s vehicle
